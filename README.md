# CarbonCopy
Copy of Carbon app (not exactly) for the purpose of learning Kotlin.

I made this app to learn the Kotlin language. It is for use in the card game Magic the Gathering in the format of Commander. It tracks the life totals of four players.
Starting life totals are 40 and you can add and subtract from the life total and reset it all back to 40 to begin a new game.
