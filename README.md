# CarbonCopy
Copy of Carbon app (not exactly) for the purpose of learning Kotlin.

I made this app to learn the Kotlin language. It is for use in the card game Magic the Gathering
in the format of Commander. It tracks the life totals of four players.
Starting life totals are 40 and you can add and subtract from the life total and reset it all back
to 40 to begin a new game.

Online I found a guide to colors that are easily distinguishable for people who are various types
of color blind which is why I picked the colors that I did.

I hope to add some features that allow for various forms of notation of types of damage and such but
I am having issues displaying them in a way that does not clutter up the look too much.

Tested on Note 5, Note 8, Note 9, Fold 3.
